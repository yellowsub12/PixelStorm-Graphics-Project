# Computer-Graphics-Project

Features:
- Basic tile generation logic
- Basic day/night cycle
- randomly placed textures on each block
- ocean plane
- camera system (with bounds)

TO DO:
- Individual block tile generation
- Tile and block placement logic
- Seed based random generation of everything (we probably need to create a randomizer engine, a small one anyways)
- 2 pass shadow algorithm and basic lighting
- collision for everything

Nice to have features:
- Blending between the day and night skyboxes
- any kind of animation in the city that makes it feel alive
- weather system (rudimentary or otherwise)
(ADD ANY OTHER NICE TO HAVE FEATURES ON THE LIST)


Notes:
- We can also use the randomness on the ocean plane to give it a texture of anything other than an ocean. We can make it look like the whole city is surrounded by either desserts, plains, or other water bodies. Basically we can randomize the ocean plane texture below city in addition to randomizing everything inside the city.
